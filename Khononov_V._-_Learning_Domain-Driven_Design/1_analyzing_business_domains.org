* Analyzing Business Domains

** Strategic Design
*** There is no sense in talking about the solution before we agree on the problem
*** Strategic aspect
**** What? - what software we are building?
**** Why? - why we are building it?
*** Tactical part
**** How? - how each component is implemented?

** What Is a Business Domain?
*** A business domain defines a company’s main area of activity
*** Examples
**** FedEx - courier delivery
**** Starbucks - coffee
**** Walmart - retail

** What Is a Subdomain?

*** Fine-grained area of business activity

*** Types of Subdomain
**** Core
***** What a company does differently from its competitors
***** Examples
****** Uber
******* Ridesharing
******* Optimize: reducing costs by matching riders heading in the same direction
****** Google Search's ranking algorithm
******* Link to ads platform
***** Naturally complex
***** Not necessarily technical
****** Jewelry maker example
**** Generic
***** Business activities that all companies are performing in the same way
***** Do not provide any competitive edge for the company
***** Examples
****** Authentication and authorization
****** Online shop for jewelry maker
****** Encryption algorithm
**** Supporting
***** Do not provide any competitive advantage
***** Simple
***** Examples
****** ETL operations
****** CRUD interfaces - validating and convert

*** Comparing Subdomains
**** Competitive advantage
***** Only core subdomain
***** Example: providing the same level of service as competitors do, but at lower costs
**** Complexity
***** Supporting - simple
***** Generic - neither simple nor trivial
****** “Known unknowns”
***** Core - complex
***** Questions
****** Can be turned into a side business?
****** Would someone pay for it?
****** Would it be simpler and cheaper to hack own implementation, rather than integration an external?
***** FIGURE The business differentiation and business logic complexity of the three types of subdomains
**** Volatility
***** Core subdomains can change often
****** If a problem can be solved on the first attempt, it’s probably not a good competitive advantage
**** Solution strategy
***** Core - have to be implemented in-house
***** Generic - buy a product or adopt an open source solution
***** Supporting - implementing in-house
****** There are no ready-made solutions
